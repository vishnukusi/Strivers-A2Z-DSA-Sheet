QUESTION:-
Given an array Arr of size N, print second largest distinct element from an array.

Example:

Input:
N = 6
Arr[] = {12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1}
Output: 34
Explanation: The largest element of the
array is 35 and the second largest element
is 34.

    
APPROACH
-> If the current element is larger than ‘large’ then update second_large and large variables
-> Else if the current element is larger than ‘second_large’ then we update the variable second_large.
-> Once we traverse the entire array, we would find the second largest element in the variable second_large.

// CODE:-
arr = [1,4,6,7]
def maximumfunc(arr):
  x = max(arr)
  arr.remove(x)
  return max(arr)
print(maximumfunc(arr))

// TIME COMPLEXITY = O(N)
// SPACE COMPLEXITY = O(0)
